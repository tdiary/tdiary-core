= Select-plugin plugin

== Abstract
Selects which plugin to be actually used.

== Usage
Put this file into the plugin/ directory.

Next, move the plugins you want to be optional into another directory.
In the example below, these plugins are assumed to be in
plugin/selectable directory.

Finally, edit the tdiary.conf file in the same directory as tdiary.rb
and add the following line:
  @conf.options['sp.path'] = 'misc/plugin'
to indicate the directory you have put the optional plugins. It can be
an absolute path.

You can use this plugin in a secure diary.

== Options
:@conf.options['sp.path']
	Directory name where the optional plugins are, relative from the
  directory where tdiary.rb is or absolute.

:@conf.options['sp.usenew']
  Define true if you want to the users to try a newly installed plugin.
	Newly installed plugins are detected next time when the user configures
	this plugin.
